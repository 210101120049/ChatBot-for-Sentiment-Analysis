    "   - TextBlob is a Python library for processing textual data. \n",
    "     It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, \n",

    "\n",
    "   - You calculate the sentiment using TextBlob or Vader. \n",
    "     Based on the polarity and subjectivity, you determine whether it is a positive text or negative or neutral. \n",
    "     For TextBlog, if the polarity is >0, it is considered positive, <0 -is considered negative and ==0 is considered neutral.\n",
